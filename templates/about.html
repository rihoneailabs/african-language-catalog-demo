            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Mission</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">
                The African Languages Catalog is dedicated to celebrating and preserving the rich linguistic diversity
                of the African continent. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive, accessible resource for anyone
                interested in learning about the myriad languages spoken across Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to raise awareness about the importance of language diversity, promote language preservation
                efforts, and foster appreciation for the cultural heritage embedded in each language.

            <p class="mb-4">
                Africa is home to an extraordinary linguistic tapestry, with estimates ranging from 1,500 to over 2,000
                distinct languages. This represents about 30% of the world's languages, spoken by only about 17% of the
                global population.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Some key facts about African languages:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>The continent is home to several major language families, including Niger-Congo, Afroasiatic,
                    Nilo-Saharan, and Khoisan.</li>
                <li>Some African countries, like Nigeria and Cameroon, are home to hundreds of languages each.</li>
                <li>Many African languages are endangered, with some having fewer than 1,000 speakers.</li>
                <li>Africa is also home to several widely spoken languages, some with over 100 million speakers, such as
                    Swahili, Hausa, and Arabic.</li>
